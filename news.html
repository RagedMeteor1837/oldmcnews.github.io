    <div class="content">
      <p>One does not simply walk into the Nether, but it seems that’s what everyone is about to do anyway…<br /></p>
<p>Today we’re releasing the full Nether Update in all its glory! Traverse through familiar, fiery wastes into new unexplored fungal forests, spooky valleys, and deltas brimming with basalt.<br /></p>
<p>Dig your way through these biomes and you might be able to find a new curious material, suspiciously titled “ancient debris”. What will you make of it (it’s totally not Netherite)?<br /></p>
<p>Fight your way through hordes of Piglins… Or don’t! They’re actually pretty cool if you bring some bling. And in case you find yourself in the wrong end of a bargain, make sure that you have access to a functional respawn anchor.<br /></p>
<p>I advise you to not use your regular bed unless you’re feeling a bit… “adventurous”.<br /></p>
